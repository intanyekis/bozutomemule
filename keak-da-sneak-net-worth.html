He’s been active in the music industry since 1991 and is identified by his scratchy, gruff voice. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Keak da Sneak? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $400,000, mostly earned through success in the music industry. He coined the term “hyphy” and led the Hyphy Movement which started in the early 2000s. As he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Keak Da Sneak Net Worth $400,000</h3><p>Keak attended Allendale Elementary School and started building popularity thanks to joining various talent shows. He then attended Bret Harte Junior High, meantime performing in theatre too.</p><p>It was then that he would meet his collaborator Agerman – the two formed Dual Committee at the age of 15 and their performances were recorded on the 1994 EP “The Autopsy” by C-BO. During the end of junior year in high school, Sneak added rapper BA to their group to form 3X Crazy, and they released their first EP entitled “Sick-O” in 1995, which led them to sign with Virgin Records the following year. In 1997, they released their first album entitled “Stackin’ Chips”, which gained popularity nationally. Their net worth continued to build, when they then recorded their second album entitled “Immortalized”. In 2000, they released “Real Talk 2000”, followed four years later by the final 3X Krazy album entitled “flowamatic-9” in 2004. The album consisted of remixed “Sick-O” songs, and other previously unreleased material.</p><p>Keak moved on to become a solo artist at Moe Doe Records. His first album was entitled “Sneakacydal”, which started receiving a lot of airplay. Since then, he’s collaborated with other recording artists, including Lil Wayne, MC Hammer and Akon, and was also featured in “My Super Sweet 16”. His net worth quickly grew thanks to these varied opportunities. Other projects he has released throughout his tenure include “Hi-Tek”, “Counting Other People’s Money”, “That’s My Word” and “Thizz Iz Allndadoe”.He also worked with <a href=#>Messy Marv</a>, San Quinn and PSD Tha Drivah for collaborative albums. A few of his latest projects include the albums “Keak Hendrix” and “Cheddar Cheese I Say”, adding steadily to his net worth.</p><p>Sneak is also known for coining the slang term hyphy, which means hyperactive, which usually described his music, the culture that associated with his music, and the area he grew up in. Later on, many Bay Area rappers started adapting the hyphy culture due to commercial hip hop not acknowledging their contributions to the industry. The music is typified by pounding rhythms and gritty music; a ridiculous fast-paced dance was also associated to the music. It became a strong influence in rap music in the 2010s, and one of the major influences in EDM and Trap music.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Keak was married to De’ undra Bowens, but is now believed to be single. He is very active on social media, specifically on Twitter on which he has more than 22,000 followers – he updates his account regularly. In early 2017, it was reported that he was shot but he soon recovered from the incident, on which details are lacking.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Tunnel Vision</td><td>2016/I</td><td>Short</td><td>Keak da Sneak</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Ozone West</td><td>2008</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Ghostride the Whip</td><td>2008</td><td>Video documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>106 & Park Top 10 Live</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Freestyle Friday Judge</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2555343_Keak-Da-Sneak/2555343_Ghostride-the-Whip-2008.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2555343_Keak-Da-Sneak/2555343_Ozone-West-2008.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2555343_Keak-Da-Sneak/2555343_Tunnel-Vision-2016.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqScmqNdma5uv82emKRlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lil-scrappy-bio-age-net-worth-profession.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lil Scrappy Bio, Age, Net Worth, Profession">&larr;
