Giannina Gibelli and Damian Powers connected during the inaugural season and Damian's proposal was super emotional.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Jessica Batten moved on from Love Is Blind</a> after fans said some negative things about her following a controversial episode where she let her dog have some wine. And after she finished filming season 1 of Love Is Blind, Giannina Gibelli seems to have been absolutely loving life. Giannina's life has changed a lot and she seems to be totally thriving.</p><h2 id=love-is-blind-39-s-giannina-gibelli-searched-for-love-after-damian-powers>Love Is Blind's Giannina Gibelli Searched For Love After Damian Powers</h2><p>The most fun part of watching Love Is Blind is trying to guess which couples will get married. Sometimes it's obvious from the start. In season 3, for instance, it was pretty clear that Alexa Alfia and Brennon Lemieux would stay together. And sometimes, there are so many twists and turns along the way that the wedding day is a big surprise. In Giannina and Damian's case, they always had a dramatic romance.</p><p>Once the couple moved in together, they fought on a regular basis. And they argued with such passion that it felt like they could either get married or go their separate ways forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Love-Is-Blind-After-the-Altar---Francesca-Farago-Damian-Powers-and-Giannina-Gibelli.jpg><p>Although Damian said no at the altar, the couple got back together after the series. But when they appeared on the Love Is Blind season 1 After The Altar special, and Damian appeared to be flirting with Francesa Farago, it was clear that things were rocky. Damian and Giannina then broke up.</p><p>In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giannina spoke about not being in a relationship</a> with Damian anymore. She was interviewed by Entertainment Tonight and said that she was happy to be living her life in the public eye instead of keeping things under wraps because of starring on Love Is Blind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reality star said, "For the first time in like three years I feel like I don't have to keep some sort of my life private anymore. We were just under wraps about everything. I was still trying to figure out, how does my life look without him in it? It's been a long time but I feel really good. I've processed it all. I'm such at peace."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/F13B6FB1-26F5-44C3-A91E-4D326790C44A.png><p>Giannina also said, "I am officially single" and added in her interview with Entertainment Tonight, "I've moved on. I feel really, really good. I'm definitely at a really good place in my life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Love Is Blind: Hints That Damian And Giannina's Relationship Drama Was Fake</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems like Giannina felt really happy after her Love Is Blind experience and was ready to find real love. And so it makes sense that when she decided to go on another reality series, that's exactly what happened.</p><h2 id=giannina-gibelli-starred-on-all-star-shore-and-met-blake-horstmann>Giannina Gibelli Starred On All Star Shore And Met Blake Horstmann</h2><p>Giannina gave reality TV a second try when she starred on the Paramount+ series All Star Shore, which premiered in June 2022 and featured people who have been on reality shows before. <a href=#>Giannina is serious about Blake</a> Horstmann. They were both cast members on All Star Shore and announced in the summer of 2022 that they were together. And they are still going really strong.</p><p>Both Giannina and Blake have a lot of experience with trying to find love on reality TV. Blake starred in season 14 of Bachelor In Paradise. And while they both were unable to find real, lasting love on their respective shows, All Star Shore definitely worked for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Giannina-Gibelli-Blake-Horstmann.jpg><p>Giannina explained what she likes about Blake to E! News and said, “I’ve never watched the Bachelor franchise or any of that so I didn’t know who he was. He seemed familiar to me and he just flashed his big ole smile at me and that’s how I met him right on the beach."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lauren And Cameron Are The Favorite Love Is Blind Couple, But Their Relationship Has Been Difficult Since The Show</a></span></p><p>Giannina added, 'He’s very respectful, but I don’t think that they know just how funny and spontaneous and dedicated he is. He’s doing his DJ gig now and just watching him reach all these new heights and all these goals, I don’t think a lot of people know that he has it in him, but he definitely does.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/giannina-gibelli.jpg><p>Giannina appears to have met her match in Blake. And he definitely feels the same way about her. When he wished his girlfriend a happy 30th birthday on April 3rd, 2023, he called her his "best friend" and praised "her goofy giggle" and "The way she looks at me when she thinks I’m not looking."</p><h2 id=since-love-is-blind-giannina-gibelli-travels-regularly>Since Love Is Blind, Giannina Gibelli Travels Regularly</h2><p>According to Refinery 29, Giannina worked in social media before she starred on Love Is Blind, and she seems to be making money as an influencer now. According to The Hollywood Reporter, she found representation with CAA in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Giannina often promotes various products on her Instagram account. In April 2023, she shared a video of herself attending Coachella and said that she was working with Neutrogena. Previously, she worked with Stella Rosa Wines.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Giannina Gibelli/Francesca Farago Drama Explained</a></span></p><p>It seems like since her time on Love Is Blind ended, Giannina has decided to travel more. Her Instagram is filled with photos of her adventures. She went to Chicago to meet up with Natalie Lee and Deepti Vempati, who starred on season 2 of Love Is Blind. And in 2023, she spent time in Las Vegas, San Diego, and New Orleans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/giannina-gibelli-smiling.jpg><p>In April 2023, Giannina shared a post sharing some travel tips with her followers. She wrote in the caption, "I pretty much live at the airport and nonstop traveling for the past three years has taught me a thing or two."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Giannina said she prefers to wear bodysuits and a black outfit when she heads to the airport. She also said that making sure to get water and food before boarding the plane is a must, along with having packing cubes in her suitcase.</p><p>Giannina Gibelli seems more content than ever before. And while her relationship with Blake Horstmann must have a lot to do with that, she seems lighter and freer than she did when starring on season 1 of Love Is Blind. Giannina seems to be focusing on the positive and having fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brPImqWnoZ6Weqi1wZ6jpaFdoby3sYyiqmaanJ67pXnSnpisp55ifnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-did-letecia-stauch-do.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Letecia Stauch?
