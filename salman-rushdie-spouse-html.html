The fact that somebody of that stature and caliber wanted to take me to lunch was kind of unbelievable," shared Lakshmi to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple had their first date in Central Park, and they ended up taking it to the bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p>Lakshmi shared that his words seduced her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They eventually moved in together, but only after Lakshmi was convinced that Rushdie's marriage with his third wife was completely over.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Padma Lakshmi's Spouse Salman Rushdie</strong> (Source: History of Literature Podcast/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2004, the duo tied the knot, and the Emmy-nominated host recalled that the initial days of their relationship were "blissful" and passionate.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She shared that her spouse&nbsp;would make her breakfast in bed every morning&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Lakshmi was on cloud nine as she felt she had finally found somebody who understood her because Rushdie, too, was an Indian living in the West.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Padma Lakshmi's Impending Divorce</h2><p>Everything was going great for the cookbook author, but little did she know that her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">marriage would&nbsp;fall apart</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As their marriage blossomed, so did Lakshmi's food career, but instead of celebrating and supporting his wife, her spouse&nbsp;resented it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The Satanic Verses&nbsp;author was miserable because&nbsp;the host could no longer attend to his needs fully.&nbsp;</p><p>Lakshmi also wrote of having to console her husband every time the Nobel prize went to someone else.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But this is just one of the less insidious and disturbing recollections.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to the chef, her husband was aloof about her endometriosis, which had gotten more acute.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, she was often in chronic pain and unable to have sex.</p><p>But instead of showing support, Rushdie accused of using her condition as an excuse not to have sex.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"It's not that I didn't want to be there for him, but something was deeply wrong. And I didn't understand it. And that caused a lot of misunderstanding," said the chef.&nbsp;</p><p>They were constantly fighting that at one point, he called her "a bad investment."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>The tipping point came when Rushdie went away on a trip saying "the show must go on" after Lakshmi had a five-hour surgery that resulted in stitches and stents.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After recovery, the first thing Lakshmi did was see a divorce lawyer, and just like that, their marriage ended after three years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuRobqiuoyrrKyglJ6ybr%2FPqKysnV6dwa64</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-paul-reubens-married-personal-life-glimpse.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Paul Reubens Married, Personal Life Glimpse The Talks Today">&larr;
