While she'll definitely talk about the movies that she stars in as she seems passionate about her acting craft, she doesn't speak much about her dating life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>actress has done a lot since The Notebook</a> and that includes becoming a mother of two kids.

The couple seems to be doing great and since they have a family, it definitely seems likely that they would have gotten married if they wanted to.</p><p>In the summer of 2020, the actress announced that they were having baby number two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also seems like if the couple ever does decide to get married, they might not announce it publicly, or it might be a while before people found it.</p><p>PopSugar commented on how Rachel and James <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep their relationship out of the spotlight</a>. The publication notes that people found out about their romance in 2016. Jamie wrote and directed the movie 10 Years, which was released in 2011, and he also wrote the 2010 Nicholas Sparks movie Dear John. His other writing credits include 2016's Money Monster and 2006's We Are Marshall.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Actor Inspired Rachel McAdams To Prepare For Her 'Mean Girls' Role</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel McAdams definitely sounded like a romantic when she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about her movie About Time</a>.</p><p>In an interview with Collider.com, she said that she likes taking on projects that include romance: "I love stories with love in them. I just prefer those films. Every so often, I come across a film where there’s no love story. It doesn’t have to be romantic, but there’s a lack of love, and I don’t get that." While Rachel McAdams has starred in Game Night and Spotlight, it's definitely true that many of her movies have been romances. And she does such a great job in them.</p><p>Rachel McAdams also has a lot of sweet things to say about parenthood. The star is now 43 years old and she was pregnant at 39. She said that she felt ready and comfortable with thinking about her baby all the time since she was 39 when she became a mom. She explained to The Sunday Times, "It’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me, hands down."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rachel McAdams Rejected This Role Three Times</a></span></p><h2 id=rachel-mcadams-had-several-famous-partners>Rachel McAdams Had Several Famous Partners</h2><p>While Rachel McAdams and James Linden are together now, the beloved actress has dated a lot of famous people.</p><p>According to PopSugar, she dated Michael Sheen from 2010 to 2013, and people think that she and Taylor Kitsch were together in 2015.</p><p>Of course, fans know that Rachel McAdams was in a serious relationship with Ryan Gosling, her co-star from The Notebook, and it's definitely safe to say that many people hoped that they would stay together and that there would be wedding bells in their future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007, Ryan Gosling spoke to GQ about their relationship and said, “People do Rachel and me a disservice by assuming we were anything like the people in that movie.
