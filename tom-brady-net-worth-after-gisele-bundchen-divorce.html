They took to Instagram to share the news, emphasizing they plan to continue "co-parenting with love." the couple had been together for over 16 years and had never shied away from sharing their love with the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Little Known Facts About Tom Brady's First Born, Jack Edward</a></span></p><p>Along with being one of the most well-known couples in the world, <a href=#>the pair was also one of the richest</a>. Their combined net worth totaled out over $700 million. This ginormous figure became the topic of discussion shortly after their divorce announcement, with the public wondering what would happen to the pair's wealth.</p><h2 id=what-was-tom-39-s-net-worth-prior-to-marrying-gisele-b-uuml-ndchen>What Was Tom's Net Worth Prior To Marrying Gisele Bündchen?</h2><p><a href=#>Tom Brady had barely made a dent in his epic NFL career</a> by the time he and Gisele met, meaning his bank account wouldn't be near the heights it's today. Still, <a href=#>the football player had a whopping $39 million net worth in 2006</a>, the year he and Gisele got together.</p><p>By that time, Gisele was already one of the top models in the world, let alone the country. While there's no information about exactly how much she was worth at the time, it's certain she was worth more than Brady.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gisele has spoken about how difficult the first year of dating Tom was for the couple. Early into their courtship, the NFL star learned his ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan was pregnant.</p><p>But the birth of Tom and Bridget's son, Jack, actually brought Gisele and Tom much closer. "I know this was hard, but I couldn't imagine my life without [Jack]. I call him my bonus child. He opened my heart in ways I didn't even know my heart could expand," said Gisele in a 2018 interview with People Magazine.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>At 42, Gisele Bundchen Has 'A Huge List Of Things To Do' Including Rehabilitating Brazil's Biomes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gisele's devotion to their children, compared to Tom's, reportedly also played a part in their divorce. After getting married, the couple had two children, Benny and Vivian.</p><p>According to sources close to the couple, Gisele was sick of Tom not doing as much for their family as she did. "There's been trouble in the marriage over his decision to un-retire. Gisele has always been the one with the kids. They had agreed he would retire to focus on the family, then he changed his mind," an inside source told Page Six.</p><h2 id=did-tom-brady-and-gisele-b-uuml-ndchen-have-a-pre-nup>Did Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen Have A Pre-Nup?</h2><p>Sources told Page Six that the couple has an "iron clad" prenup that was established well before their nuptials in 2009. The rumors about how solid the prenup was proved to be true <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when their divorce was finalized the same day they submitted the paperwork</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They both have their own separate business entities, so separating their wealth wasn't that complicated in the end. The only other major factor was dividing up their massive property portfolio," a source close to the couple told Page Six.</p><p>In June 2022, RadarOnline reported that Gisele was looking into the prenup to ensure everything was in order. The couple had become incredibly wealthy during their marriage - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with Gisele's net worth alone sitting at around $400 million</a>.</p><p>Friends of the model guided her toward the decision to revise the document before proceeding with the divorce. Considering how much was on the line in their divorce, a little revisit before getting things going doesn't seem like a bad idea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-will-tom-brady-39-s-net-worth-be-after-divorcing-gisele-b-uuml-ndchen>What Will Tom Brady's Net Worth Be After Divorcing Gisele Bündchen?</h2><p>Tom doesn't have too much to be upset about, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as even after the divorce, his net worth stands at $333 million</a>. The couple also had an extensive real estate portfolio they divided among the two of them.</p><p><a href=#>Tom secured the couple's $17 million Miami mansion</a>, which is currently under construction. Gisele won't be far away, though, as the model purchased an $11.5 million home directly across the water from Tom's Indian Creek property.</p><p>Page Six reports that Gisele will be keeping the family's home in Costa Rica. She also will be keeping the couple's NYC apartment, which she hunkered down in during the couple's divorce proceedings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no word on who will be keeping their home in Montana. The couple purchased the house located in the exclusive Yellowstone Club for an undisclosed amount in 2017.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>16 NFL Stars We Totally Forgot Dated Stunning Celebs</a></span></p><p>Far more important than the money, Tom secured as much time with his kids as possible in his divorce settlement. The couple has agreed to share custody of their children.</p><p>"They can see whichever parent they want. They've got a schedule, but neither of them would prevent their kids from seeing the other parent. That's not who either of them are," a source close to the family told People Magazine.</p><p>On his Sirius XM podcast, the quarterback said he's focused on two things after the amicable divorce from Gisele: taking care of his family and children and winning football games. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Considering the Tampa Bay Buccaneer's have a 6-7 record this year</a>, he must be really focusing on the first part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdl7%2BisNhmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpifrJWneqi10p6jnmWSqrulr8eepWacmau8s6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fbis-katherine-renee-kane-wants-scola-and-nina-to-get-married-next.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FBI's Katherine Renee Kane Wants Scola and Nina to Get Married Next">&larr;
