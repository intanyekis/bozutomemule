And so I was just listening to that song over and over again,” she said.</p><p>As Kelsey proceeded to hum the tune, Joey added, “She’s like, ‘It hit, it hit.’ So then that was just, like, yeah, little moments like that make a huge difference.”</p><p>“Dress” was released on Swift’s 2017 album, Reputation. While fans <a href=#>initially thought the song</a> was about <strong>Ed Sheeran</strong>, other Swifties think it’s a reference to her relationship with ex <strong>Joe Alwyn</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joey-Graziadei-and-Kelsey-Anderson-Bonded-Over-This-Taylor-Swift-Song-During-The-Bachelor-3.jpg><p>During the emotional season finale, viewers watched as Joey <a href=#>got down on one knee</a> and proposed to Kelsey on the beaches of Tulum, Mexico. “I have known for a while that I’ve wanted to have a beautiful life, but I truly didn’t know how beautiful that life could be until I met you,” he told Kelsey.</p><p>Joey later admitted exclusively to Us Weekly that he knew <a href=#>he was falling in love</a> with Kelsey after their second one-on-one date in Jasper, Canada.</p><p>“It was really after our second one-on-one in Jasper, how just great that day was, how much we were starting to continue to see things move forward and not take any steps back. That was when I kind of truly knew that I was falling in love with her,” Joey said. “But as always, it’s a feeling — it takes time for you to feel comfortable to share those words, and there needs to be the right space and you need to think everything through.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2B0mahqJ2pYq6vsIyknKWrla56o7vNnZydZZ%2BrsrN505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtqmacoprAtHnSqKWgZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emilija-baranac.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emilija Baranac known for Riverdale and To All the Boys series has a Boyfriend!">&larr;
