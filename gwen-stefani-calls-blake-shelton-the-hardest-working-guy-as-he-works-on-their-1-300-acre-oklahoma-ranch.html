The ‘It’s My Life’ singer recently took to social media to give fans a glimpse of her life on the Oklahoma farm that her husband, country singer Blake Shelton owns. The Los Angeles native was seen gardening and arranging flowers in an aesthetic array while praising her husband.</p><p>Stefani shared a video where she pointed the camera toward Shelton while saying, "There he goes. Hardest working guy I've ever met. Making me work too!" She then shifted her focus toward a flower bed which she was proud to announce was the result of their hard work. While her new release. ‘True Babe’ was playing in the background, she showed the flowers and said, "We did that! With God's help."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'The Voice' Season 24: Fans want Jordan Rainer out after being 'super bored’ by her semifinals performance</a></p><p>The singer and her husband have grown not just flowers but also a delectable stack of fresh vegetables. Flaunting her ranch girl attire in a camo hoodie and straw hat, Stefani shared glimpses of her farm-grown vegetables in the video.</p><p>The flowers they plucked from the garden were then neatly arranged indoors on their dining table. In the video, sneak peeks of their dining room could be seen. A large metal peacock was placed in the corner of the room. The room had a summer vibe, with leafy wallpaper and bare surfaces were painted in teal.</p><h2 class=split>The picturesque house</h2><p>The house consists of a long driveway dotted with two rows of trees on each side. The picturesque white-colored mansion with a gray slated roof is located in front of a calm water body. The large mansion has Roman columns, a large front porch, a balcony, and an upper-floor deck, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Post</a>. Dormer windows and chimneys are visible out of the roof.&nbsp;</p><p>The main building is divided into three sections and the complex also has another detached stone house. The main building has a large middle house with two symmetrical side wings. The backyard is tastefully decorated with a terraced garden, three covered patios, and a pool with a Baja shelf.&nbsp;</p><p>One mile from the main property, there is a small homely chapel where the couple got married on July 3, 2021. The chapel was customarily built by Shelton for the occasion of their marriage.</p><p>The property, known as Ten Point Ranch, is located a few minutes away from the small town of Tishomingo, Oklahoma. The house sits comfortably on the property, which is more than 1,300 acres. Apart from the house, Shelton also owns the nearby restaurant and store, Ole Red Bar.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Blake Shelton to host 'Barmageddon' with pals Nikki Bella, Carson Daly after 'The Voice' exit</a></p><h2 class=split>Gwen Stefani shares video of their ranch</h2><p>This is, however, not the first time Stefani gave glimpses of her ranch life. In March 2023, she shared a TikTok video where she was seen driving in a 4X4 with her husband amidst the dry terrain of the forest. She also shared a glimpse of the sandy river bank where she was seen soaking in the sun in a laidback attire of a gray tee shirt and printed pants. She posted the video with a simple caption, “P.O.V.” Once she also shared glimpses of mushroom hunting in the ranch on her Instagram.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'Today' host Carson Daly shares exciting update ahead of his USA Network show 'Barmageddon's Season 2 premiere</a></p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'The Voice' Season 24 fans miss Blake Shelton as country legend Wynonna Judd joins NBC show as mega mentor</a></p><p><a href=#>Will Blake Shelton return to 'The Voice'?
