Stamos described the incident to PEOPLE as “physically painful” and “worse than anything.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the claim surfaced ahead of the memoir’s release, Copley denied cheating and said she and Stamos were already broken up. Now, she has shared her full side of the story in a 19-minute <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>YouTube video</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her response, Copley recalled the timeline of their relationship, which lasted “about a year.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said that shortly after meeting Stamos’ parents and spending time at their home, she received a phone call from his mom, Loretta, who told her, “Teri, I know that you love John, but don't plan on marrying him because he has no intention of marrying you.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>John Stamos and Teri Copley in 1984.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I remember like it was yesterday,” Copley said of the phone call.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said she “thought that John told her that, and she was a mother looking at me like a daughter type and thinking, ‘I better warn this girl not to get her hopes up.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a result, she “thought he doesn't love me,” and went to Stamos’ home to break up with him. “I just said to him, ‘John I don't think we should see each other anymore.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was young. I didn't know how to communicate with him to tell him, you know, your mother told me you didn't ever want to marry me,” Copley said, adding that she “lived with that regret.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Copley said the incident with Danza occurred about “three or four days later,” and that it happened very differently than Stamos described in his book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She claimed she saw Danza on the cover of TV Guide at the store, and in the magazine, he “said that Teri Copley was the only girl that he'd ever loved.” After reading this, Copley called Danza and he came over to her house, she said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tony Danza and Teri Copley in 1986.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his memoir, Stamos claimed that he walked into Copley's guesthouse and found the actress asleep in bed with Danza, neither fully clothed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Copley, she did not have a guesthouse. Rather, Stamos knocked on her door while Danza’s car was parked outside, and she answered the door “fully dressed.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[He] just shook his head and looked at me like, ‘How could you?’ Well I looked at him and didn't say anything either,” she said. “I just looked at him like, ‘What do you care?’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He certainly didn't come in my house and find me in bed naked with a sheet over… I mean none of that happened,” she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Copley also claimed that later in life, she and Stamos rekindled their relationship more than once, but it never lasted. After his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>divorce from Rebecca Romijn</a>, she said she decided to meet up with Stamos and come clean about the reason for their initial breakup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wanted to because I’d grown up a little bit and I wanted to tell him what happened. And so I went to his house and I sat down and I said, ‘John, did you know that your mother called me and told me that you would never marry me?’”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Teri Copley in 2014.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Albert L.

I was madly in love with you.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Copley said that from then on, she and Stamos had a “mutual friendship and love as friends.” She became teary-eyed while recalling a moment when she got to speak with Loretta years after their initial split. She also said that she attended her funeral.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Copley ended her response by revealing that she felt “sideswiped” by Stamos’ claims of infidelity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also shared that “seeing him carelessly throw me out there like a dirty dish rag for people to just make fun of" and "make all these assumptions" about was "very hurtful and surprising to me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That's not the John that I ever knew,” she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wanted to come on and share from my heart — just from my heart, just transparent — what happened as I lived it, and just to say to John that I forgive you,” she finished. “I forgive you, John. I prayed for you to get married and have a beautiful family and I'm so happy. I'm so happy for you and I will continue to pray for you and your family, your beautiful wife, your beautiful son.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Copley has been married to Charles Wahlheim since 1992, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>IMDB</a>.
