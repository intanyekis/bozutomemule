She</b></strong><strong> is an American real estate developer and a businesswoman. Elizabeth and John’s love story began in high school and they remained together until 2009 when they got married. Sadly their marriage ended in 2012.</strong></p><p>While John Cena is famed as one of the greatest professional wrestlers the world has ever known, he’s also an actor and a TV personality. What this means is that the man is incredibly popular and his fame has rubbed off on people around him like Shay Shariatzadeh, the woman he got married to in 2020.</p><p>Before Shay, the WWE star was married to Elizabeth Huberdeau. The marriage packed up in 2012 but it’s as though Huberdeau is still living in the shadow of her ex-husband as she is mostly known as Cena’s ex-wife across many quarters. One can’t deny the fact that Elizabeth is only popular because of her history with the widely-celebrated wrestler but she has her own story and has built quite a successful career.</p><p>Among other things, Elizabeth Huberdeau’s marriage to John has continued to pique people’s curiosity, with many wondering what led to the end of the union after just three years.</p><p>What she has been up to since the marriage ended, the family she hails from, and what she does for a living are also part of the things that drive the public’s inquiry into Elizabeth’s life. She has largely stayed away from the limelight but we have been able to learn a few facts about her over time.</p><h2><strong>Elizabeth Huberdeau Was Born and Raised In West Newbury Massachusetts</strong></h2><p>Huberdeau is a native of West Newbury, Massachusetts and records have it she was born on the 28th of September 1979. To the best of our knowledge, she was also raised in West Newbury but details of her upbringing and the kind of family she was born into has been hard to come by.</p><p>In fact, the names of her parents are not known as she has chosen to keep their identities away from the public. Also, it is hard to tell if she was raised alongside other siblings or was an only child. The schools that Elizabeth Huberdeau attended for her primary and high school education are not known but there are strong reasons to believe she attended either Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, or Central Catholic High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts.</p><p>This is so because Huberdeau reportedly met John Cena in high school and the famous wrestler attended the schools named above. While we are yet to authenticate which of the schools Elizabeth Huberdeau attended, we can confirm she is college-educated. Like John Cena, she attended Springfield College in Massachusetts and graduated with a degree in Management.</p><h2><strong>John Cena Remains Her Claim to Fame But She Has Built a Successful Career In Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Apart from what she had with the WWE superstar, most of the details available about Elizabeth Huberdeau were deduced. Because of that, it is really hard to tell what she does for a living. While it has been reported in some quarters that she works as a broker for a real estate firm, other reports have it that she is a successful real estate agent who makes enough money to afford not just a comfortable but luxurious lifestyle.</p><p>It has also been claimed that she was a model before she got married to John Cena. If this is true, then it can be said that Elizabeth Huberdeau was quite famous as well before she became known as Cena’s wife. Nonetheless, it is widely held that her relationship with the popular wrestler is the only reason she is famous.</p><p>As she was with the wrestler through his journey to stardom, Huberdeau received a good measure of attention as the woman in John’s life. However, she isn’t one to involve herself in clout chasing; so much about her remained unknown to the public.</p><h2><strong>How Long Was Elizabeth Huberdeau John Cena’s Wife?</strong></h2><p>Elizabeth Huberdeau and John Cena’s love story as already hinted began in high school and they remained together until their divorce in 2012. She was called Liz Cena by her friends, a name she gained owing to her association with the WWE legend during their days in school.</p><p>They dated for many years until 2009 when they decided to seal their love by walking down the aisle. Cena first <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>broke the news about their marriage</a> during the promotion of his 2009 movie 12 Rounds, he dropped the big news by simply saying: “I’m gonna get married this year.” True to his words, on the 12th of July that same year, the high school sweethearts exchanged marriage vows in a lovely ceremony that took place in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>But as fate would have it, theirs wasn’t a marriage that was meant to last a long time. The wrestler filed for divorce on the 1st of May 2012 and their separation became official on the 18th of July that same year.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#OnThisDay</a> in 2012: TMZ reported that John Cena and his estranged wife Elizabeth Huberdeau finalised their divorce. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7cGSEj32Ua</a></p><p>— Allan (@allan_cheapshot) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">July 18, 2016</a></p><h3><strong>Their Marriage Lasted for Only Three Years and They Had Quite a Dramatic Separation</strong></h3><p>Barley three years into their marriage, the couple started having issues that made Cena file for divorce which ultimately brought their union to a legal end. Following their separation, a lot of speculations were made about what led to it. It was said that it had something to do with Cena’s unwillingness to have kids and a disagreement over remodeling their home.</p><p>Their divorce was quite messy as Elizabeth Huberdeau agitated that she was blindsided by John Cena’s move to end the marriage. The two had a prenup agreement before they got married but Elizabeth challenged it, alleging that Cena was seeing other women while married to her.</p><p>As far as the public knows, the cheating allegation was never substantiated. It was only reported that Elizabeth and John had patched up their differences. Raymond Rafool, the attorney that represented Liz confirmed this, stating that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>the two were able to resolve all their issues amicably</a>. The terms of the divorce settlement have never been disclosed to the public.</p><h2><strong>Where Is Elizabeth Huberdeau Now?</strong></h2><p>The two have since moved on with their lives after the divorce. Cena found love again in 2012, this time in the arms of former professional wrestler Nikki Bella. Nikki moved in with Cena in 2013, and in 2015, they were engaged. However, in July 2018, the two announced they were no longer together. Nikki is now engaged to Artem Chigvintsev and Cena is now married to Shay Shariatzadeh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Huberdeau-1-e1582017514154.jpg><p>Liz was rumored to be dating a fellow named Eli Ayoub and happily enjoying his company. However, efforts made to verify this claim haven’t yielded any meaningful results. Huberdeau had no children with Cena because the wrestler wasn’t ready to be a father. John has been very open about this; he has stated in several interviews <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>that he doesn’t want to have kids</a> because he believes he’s not capable of raising a child.</p><p>Elizabeth has embraced living a very private life since her divorce from John. She continues to evade publicity but it has been reported that she now lives in Florida.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Elizabeth Huberdeau</strong></h2><table width=677><tbody readability=4><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Elizabeth Huberdeau</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>1979 /09 /28</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nickname</strong></td><td>Liz Cena</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Single</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Birthplace</strong></td><td>West Newbury, Massachusetts, U.S</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Real Estate Business</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Colour</strong></td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Colour</strong></td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Build</strong></td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>John Cena (div.)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Springfield College</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Online Presence</strong></td><td>Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sun Sign</strong></td><td>Libra</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>How Old is Elizabeth Huberdeau?</strong></h3><p>Elizabeth Huberdeau is 44 years old.
