The striking pundit has been wed to his spouse for more than twenty years.</strong></p><p>In addition, he and his spouse Erin Manning Kellerman are parents to three children. The couple experienced some problems in the beginning of their romance, but they have moved past it and are happy.</p><p>Let’s examine his marriage in detail and learn more about it right now!</p><h2><span id=Meet_Erin_Manning_the_happy_wife_of_Max_Kellerman>Meet Erin Manning, the happy wife of Max Kellerman:</span></h2><p>Max is one of the over-the-top characters in sports commentary. Max is also well-known for getting into passionate arguments with other pundits and experts.</p><p>Nevertheless, Max is happy to see his wife and three children when he gets home from a long and exhausting day at work. He has been happily married to Erin Manning Kellerman for more than 20 years.</p><p>First, during their modest wedding in 1994, Max and Erin exchanged vows in front of their loved ones. The two haven’t looked back since.</p><h2><span id=Max_and_his_spouse_Erin_started_dating_when_How_Did_Their_Meeting_Occur>Max and his spouse Erin started dating when? How Did Their Meeting Occur?</span></h2><p>Max doesn’t often discuss his personal life on television. If you look at his social media accounts, you won’t find a single image that shows you his private life to date. We have, however, uncovered a number of details about his life for you. This offers us a vague notion of how and when their relationship began.</p><p>The sportscaster once talked about how, while they were in college, he and Erin went to a party. This suggests that they have been dating since their time in college. Additionally, Max and Erin went to Hunter College High School, the same high school. It’s quite possible that they initially connected when in high school.</p><h2><span id=Three_Daughters_Are_Shared_By_Wife_Erin_And_Max_Kellerman>Three Daughters Are Shared By Wife Erin And Max Kellerman</span></h2><p>Max feels that his three children are the greatest thing in life. Three daughters, Esther, Sam, and Mira Kellerman, are the proud parents of him and his spouse Erin.</p><p>Kellerman and his wife Erin Manning Kellerman are parents of three girls.</p><p>Max together with his two daughters.</p><p>In November 2008, the couple welcomed Esther, their eldest daughter. Fun fact: Erin arrived at work on the day that Barack Obama emerged victorious in the 2008 presidential contest. Throughout her labor, she kept an eye on the live address.</p><p>Regarding their second child, Sam, he was born in 2012. In memory of his late brother Sam Kellerman, Max named his kid. Still, in 2015, Max and Erin welcomed their third child into the world.</p><p>To him, his children are everything. In an interview with Hot 97, he even declared, “My three children are the only thing I care about in the world.”</p><h2><span id=Max_Kellerman_A_Domestic_Violence_Incident_Involving_His_Girlfriend>Max Kellerman: A Domestic Violence Incident Involving His Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Max was suspended by ESPN in 2016 due to a narrative he had written about himself and his girlfriend. He described in detail in the narrative how he smacked his now-wife after she had slapped him.</p><p>In an interview with ESPN-LA, Kellerman related a story from his time in college. Max and Erin were both much too intoxicated at a college party. Max saw his condition and his wife’s attempt to exert control when she suddenly smacked him.</p><p>With less grace, Max gave her a backslap. He immediately followed up on that declaration by stating that the woman was now his wife and the mother of his children.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TV personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ozzy Osbourne Death Hoax: Is He Dead Or Alive?
