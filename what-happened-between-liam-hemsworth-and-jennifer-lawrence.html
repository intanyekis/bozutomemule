However, that doesn’t mean that it can’t be easy to buy into an actor’s performance so much that you think there is some reality to the character they are playing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For proof of the fact that people invest too much into fictional characters, consider how disappointing it can be to learn that actors who play friends <a href=#>dislike one another in real life</a>. On top of that, over the years there have been many onscreen couples that viewers liked so much that they wanted the actors who played them to be romantically involved for real.</p><p>Ever since Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth appeared in four Hunger Games movies together, many fans of that series of films have noticed that they shared a great deal of chemistry. With that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that some fans of both actors have been hoping for them to date. That begs an obvious question, what is the nature of Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence’s relationship?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on February 13th, 2023 by Abigail Thomas: </strong>Rumors about a relationship between Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence have been circulating for years. It is hard for viewers of The Hunger Games to believe that two people who have such great chemistry on screen never crossed that line in the real world. Actors and actresses who play couples on the screen often fall for each other in real life. Though Hemsworth and Lawrence have never confirmed these rumors other than a brief comedic moment of Lawrence, fans believe that <a href=#>Miley Cyrus left clues in her recent music video for "Flowers"</a> that Hemsworth and Lawrence did in fact have a relationship. The music video is full of details about Cyrus and Hemsworth's tumultuous relationship, and the song has become a breakup anthem. Cyrus may even hint that Hemsworth cheated on her with the actress.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence Wouldn't Take On Another Role Like Mother!

In the case of Hemsworth, his on-again and off-again <a href=#>relationship with Miley Cyrus</a> has gotten a lot of attention over the years. While Hemsworth and Cyrus were married from 2018 until 2020, it seems likely their relationship is over for good at this point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Lawrence-Gives-Birth-To-First-Child.jpg><p>Jennifer Lawrence is married to an art gallery director named Cooke Maroney, and there is every chance in the world their relationship will go the distance. Together they have one son named Cy. Of course, like most adults, Lawrence dated several other people before she found her husband. For example, in the past, she was linked to Nicholas Hoult, Chris Martin, and Darren Aronofsky.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Do Fans Feel About Liam Hemsworth Joining The Witcher?</a></span></p><h2 id=did-jennifer-lawrence-confirm-a-relationship-with-hemsworth>Did Jennifer Lawrence Confirm A Relationship With Hemsworth?</h2><p>Over the years there have been several famous actors who fell for one another on set. However, the vast majority of actors who’ve locked lips on camera have kept their relationship professional the rest of the time. For that reason, most people who like the idea of Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence as a couple likely assumed they would never hear about things heating up between them. Instead, Lawrence once revealed that things have gotten steamy between her and Hemsworth in the past.</p><p>In the year 2015, Jennifer Lawrence went on the talk show Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. Since that show has a long history of getting stars to gossip and Lawrence is known for her willingness to speak her mind, the idea of her appearing on the show was exciting for most viewers. At one point in the show, Andy Cohen asked Lawrence about Liam Hemsworth and her response sent tongues wagging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the start of the conversation, Andy Cohen brought up Liam Hemsworth by saying; “It has recently been rumored that you and Liam Hemsworth had some PDA at the Waverly Inn. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Have you two ever kissed</a> when the cameras weren’t rolling?” Without missing a beat, Lawrence quickly replied; “Liam and I grew up together. Liam’s real hot. What would you have done?” Lawrence asked before admitting, “Yeah, I have.” Still not through, Cohen followed up by talking about how he’d pick Liam Hemsworth’s Hunger Games character over the one brought to life by Josh Hutcherson. With a smile on her face, Lawrence said “I did, at one point” before high-fiving Cohen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence Admits She Never Should Have Accepted The Role In Passengers</a></span></p><h2 id=lawrence-and-hemsworth-have-a-strong-friendship>Lawrence And Hemsworth Have A Strong Friendship</h2><p>Even though many fans have wanted to see Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence become a couple, it seems very unlikely that will happen. However, that doesn’t mean that they haven’t played an important role in one another’s lives. During a 2014 interview with Nylon Magazine, Lawrence talked about Liams Hemsworth and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the role he plays in her life</a>.</p><p>"I guess the thing that surprised me is that I would never expect to ever have a man this good-looking ever be my best friend. I just would never assume those things could happen, but he is. He's the most wonderful, lovable, family-oriented, sweet, hilarious, amazing guy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of singing the praises of Liam Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence went on to talk about how he has helped to change her for the better. "[He] actually taught me how to be fair and to stand up for myself. It's my biggest weakness: negotiating. I'm a wimp about standing up for myself and Liam is always fair. He's always on time, he's always doing his job, and he's good about making sure that things stay fair. He's teaching me to toughen up a little bit. That was important. I need that."</p><p>Did Miley Cyrus Accuse Hemsworth Of Cheating?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2023, Liam Hemsworth ex-wife Miley Cyrus released a song and music video called "Flowers." The song is <a href=#>a female version of Bruno Mars's "When I Was Your Man,"</a> and seems to tell the story of Hemsworth and Cyrus's on-and-off again relationship. Fans have analyzed the song and its video for clues, and they have come to the conclusion that Cyrus is referencing Lawrence in numerous shots of the video, specifically the gold dress and pool scene. Fans think Cyrus is implying that Hemsworth cheated on her with the Hunger Games actress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpJmWum60xKaqsKeiqbVurc2dZKOdnqO2p7HRZqOar6Kau6Sxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./geoff-marshall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Geoff Marshall">&larr;
