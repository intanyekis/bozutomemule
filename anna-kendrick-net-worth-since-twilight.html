On the other hand, that has never been the case for Hollywood A-list actress Anna Kendrick who <a href=#>played a minor character</a> in the highly successful franchise.</p><p>That said, this lack of recognition doesn’t seem to bother the Portland, Maine native one bit. After all, Kendrick has gone on to headline several box-office hits. Over the course of her career, the actress has also managed to collect several hefty paychecks.</p><h2 id=anna-kendrick-had-a-supporting-role-in-the-twilight-franchise>Anna Kendrick Had A Supporting Role In The Twilight Franchise</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/anna-kendrick-and-kristen-stewart-in-twilight-via-youtube-moviesphere.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendrick had been a working actor long before Twilight, however, having already earned her first Tony nomination when she was only 12 for <a href=#>her performance in Broadway’s High Society</a>. Years later, while the actress was in high school, she also starred in the comedy Camp, which earned the actress her first Independent Spirit Award nomination.</p><p>That said, this wasn’t the film that got Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke thinking about Kendrick. As it turns out, it was her work in the dramedy Rocket Science, which won rave reviews in Sundance. Even though Hardwicke recognized the actress though, Kendrick was almost certain that she wasn’t going to land the job.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anna Kendrick Revealed Insights Into Her "Toxic" Failed Romances: Here's An Inside Look At What It's Really Like to Date Her</a></span></p><p>While doing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a career retrospective for Vanity Fair</a>, the actress recalled doing the Twilight auditions alongside good friend Mae Whitman while thinking that it was going to be “such a blow-off audition.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much to Kendrick’s surprise, however, she got cast as Bella’s (Kristen Stewart) friend, Jessica Stanley. And while the actress has said that the Twilight cast was a “really great group of people” to work with, making the first <a href=#>film felt like a “trauma event”</a> since filming in Portland, Oregon left her “cold and miserable.”</p><p>Despite her experience making the first movie, however, Kendrick stuck around the franchise, recalling that the weather was no longer “quite as intense” when they worked on the second installment, New Moon. Kendrick also went on to star in all the other Twilight films, except for Breaking Dawn – Part 2.</p><h2 id=since-then-kendrick-has-starred-in-several-other-movies>Since Then, Kendrick Has Starred In Several Other Movies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anna-Kendrick.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, even after doing just one Twilight movie, Kendrick didn’t waste time booking other projects. For instance, in between Twilight and New Moon, the actress starred alongside George Clooney in the dramedy Up in the Air.</p><p>This later earned Kendrick her very first Oscar nod. Meanwhile, in between Eclipse and Breaking Dawn – Part 1, she also joined the cast of the action-comedy Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and the dramedy 50/50 with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen.</p><p>After wrapping up her time in the Twilight Saga, Kendrick also continued with her film work, immediately doing movies such as What to Expect When You're Expecting with Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez as well as End of Watch with Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. Not long after, the actress also found herself auditioning for the film Pitch Perfect where she took everyone by complete surprise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it came to the Pitch Perfect auditions, actors had to showcase their singing skills as early as the auditions, and in the early drafts of the script, Beca’s audition piece had been I’m a Little Teapot. Kendrick, however, decided to do something different, performing a routine that she had seen on YouTube.</p><p>After watching her performance, Pitch Perfect director Jason Moore told Insider that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">everyone was “flabbergasted.”</a> Her Cups performance was also so memorable that it made it to the first film’s final cut.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anna Kendrick Is Extremely Secretive About Her Relationships But Here's What We Do Know About Her Love Life</a></span></p><p>Pitch Perfect also went on to be a huge box office success, so much so that it launched a new franchise for Kendrick with two installments so far. Aside from these films, the actress also went on do other films such as the drama Cake with Jennifer Aniston, the action-thriller The Accountant with Ben Affleck, and the crime-comedy A Simple Favor with Blake Lively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendrick has also ventured into voice acting over the years, voicing the character of Poppy in the Trolls franchise, most recently working on the 2021 film Trolls Holiday in Harmony. The actress also stars in the upcoming follow-up, Trolls Band Together.</p><h2 id=here-39-s-anna-kendrick-39-s-net-worth-years-after-doing-twilight-films>Here's Anna Kendrick's Net Worth Years After Doing Twilight Films</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/anna-kendrick.jpg><p>Recent reports estimate Kendrick’s at $20 million. While her salary per movie has never been publicly disclosed, the actress once revealed that her work for Twilight helped sustain her financially as she was going from project to project during her early years in Hollywood.</p><p>In an excerpt from her memoir, Scrappy Little Nobody, (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via Vulture</a>) Kendrick revealed that the franchise “kept me in room and board while I did their movies for no money.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As turns out, the actress didn’t get paid much when she did Up in the Air and several other movies, despite the critical acclaim and award nominations. So, while other films gave her more recognition in the industry, the Twilight franchise allowed Kendrick to pay her bills, although she would never say how much she got paid per film.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anna Kendrick Still Thinks She's Better At Acting Than Singing, Even After Pitch Perfect</a></span></p><p>As for the Pitch Perfect films, it is unclear how much Kendrick received for her work on the first movie. That said, reports have indicated that for Pitch Perfect 3, the actress’ salary was bumped to $6 million. At the same time, it is also believed that Kendrick managed to negotiate for a share of the backend earnings for the third installment, which means that she took home a lot more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like with the Pitch Perfect franchise, Kendrick’s salary for the Trolls movies has also never been disclosed publicly. That said, the actress, along with fellow lead star Justin Timberlake, was reportedly asking NBCUniversal for seven-figure bonuses following the studio’s sudden decision to make Trolls World Tour available for rent online.</p><p>Meanwhile, aside from the upcoming Trolls movie, Kendrick is also attached to several other new projects. This includes the crime drama The Dating Game, which also marks her directing debut.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp6aRYrimusOroJyjXaOytXnWqKmtoF2otq%2BvxGarsKGcnrSpwI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./blueface-mother-legal-action-access-grandchildren.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bluefaces Mother Threatens Legal Action Over Her Grandchildren">&larr;
