She was born in 1989, yet her exact birthdate is unknown. She works as a social worker and a model.</strong></p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_Of_Christiana_Barkley>Net Worth Of Christiana Barkley</span></h2><p>By November 2022, her estimated net worth was <strong>one million dollars</strong>. Her primary sources of income are modeling and charitable work.</p><h2><span id=Family>Family</span></h2><p>Charles Barkley, a former NBA star, and Christiana Barkley’s mother, Maureen Blumhardt, are her parents. She is a young person of mixed ancestry, with both Caucasian and African roots. Her mouth was predisposed to success from birth.</p><p>Her father, Charles, played a major role in developing her into the person she is today. Although Charles is no longer playing basketball, he still supports the sport by working as an analyst for Inside the NBA.</p><p>Christiana’s grandparents are Charcey Glenn and Frank Barkley. After 25 years of marriage, her parents got a divorce. Despite being apart, they maintained a relationship with their family.</p><p>She enjoys taking part in charity events and other social activities that help others because she is a social worker, and she frequently goes to events with her parents.</p><p>In 2016, she and her mother also went to the Fresh Start Fashion Gala’s 20th anniversary. It was a successful fundraiser that netted more than $1.5 million.</p><h2><span id=Her_background_in_the_workplace>Her background in the workplace</span></h2><p>She had a brief stint working for Turner Sports as a sales assistant. Christiana graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Pennsylvania’s Villanova University. In order to continue a career in journalism after that, she enrolled in the Columbia Journalism School in 2016.</p><p>However, she doesn’t do any journalism-related work. After graduating from college, she seems to have loathed all media.</p><p>She has not participated in any journalistic activity since graduating from journalism school, therefore it is unclear whether she plans to pursue a career in journalism or not. It’s also uncertain if she has developed any more interests.</p><h2><span id=Background_of_Christiana_Barkley8217s_family>Background of Christiana Barkley’s family</span></h2><p>Charles Barkley and Maureen Blumhardt, Christiana’s parents, cherish her because she is their lone child. One of the best 50 NBA players of all time is her father, Charles. After leaving the NBA, her father now works as a pundit for the league.</p><p>The mother of Christiana is a philanthropist, actress, and model. She is a very active member of the Fresh Start Women’s Foundation, a non-profit group established to support women in leading honorable lives.</p><h2><span id=Where_were_Christiana8217s_parents_married>Where were Christiana’s parents married?</span></h2><p>They first ran into each other at a dining establishment. Since then, a sincere romantic relationship has grown between them. Following their initial conversations, they finally began dating. Following that, in 1989, they got hitched.</p><p>Within a few months of their marriage, they became parents to Christiana. Christiana’s Internet Scandal: After her nude images on Twitter went public, she became involved in an online controversy.</p><p>However, it was later discovered that the person identified as Villanova was actually a doppelganger and not Christiana. Christiana also didn’t upload any pictures.</p><p>Ilya Hoffman is the husband of Christiana Hoffman. Her spouse was playing in the basketball game where they first met, although he wasn’t a big sports fan. He founded the New York-based marketing technology company DemandByete.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/"}{"1":80}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Daughter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Cazzie David | Larry David Daughter, Her Boyfriend, Dating, Family</a></h3>Cazzie David, 28, is the eldest daughter of comedian and writer Larry David and his ex-wife, environmental activist Laurie David.
