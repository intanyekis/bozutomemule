The <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">58-year-old Dr. Dre</a>, born Andre Romelle Young began his successful rap career in the mid 1980’s and has inspired the work of hundreds in the music business.</p><p>Dre gained recognition after he co-founded Death Row Records in 1991 with Suge Knight and worked on debut albums by <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Snoop Dogg</a> and Tupac Shakur. Luckily, Dre left Death Row Records by 1996 and escaped the West Coast/East Coast feud that resulted in the deaths of Shakur and Biggie Smalls.</p><p>After creating a new label, Aftermath Entertainment, Dre teamed up with rappers Eazy-E and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Ice Cube</a>, releasing the iconic Straight Outta Compton album in 1998 and has continued a successful solo career since, but it’s the other stars the rapper has discovered that may be his claim to fame.</p><p>Find out who had the skills and the fortitude to connect with Dre and launch their careers into stardom.</p><h2 id=xzibit-500-000>Xzibit – $500,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans might find Xzibit’s net worth surprising but don’t forget the rapper has had <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">financial issues in recent years</a>. Things were going well when he caught the eye of Dre in the late 90’s and scored several high profile guests spots with Ice Cube, Eminem, Limp Bizkit and others, however, in 2022, he said he was no longer the primary breadwinner between his ex-wife and himself based on a major loss of income due to cancelled shows during COVID. If unfamiliar with his music, perhaps audiences recognize him from hosting <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">MTV’s Pimp My Ride</a> in the early 2000’s.</p><h2 id=warren-g-6-million>Warren G – $6 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the 90’s, Warren G joined rappers Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg to form the trio 213. After little success, he <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">launched his debut album</a> a few short years later and became a household name or song with hits like “Regulate”. It doesn’t hurt that Warren G is the step-brother of Dr. Dre, who produced some of his biggest hits, but Warren has worked hard to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">not live in his brother’s shadow</a>, creating his own music and his own path over the years.</p><h2 id=eve-10-million>Eve – $10 Million</h2><p>Eve’s relationship with Dr. Dre and Aftermath Entertainment was short lived, but it did set her on the path to success. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the rapper and actress was able to audition for Dre at the age of 18 and he signed her to his label. Though she was eventually dropped, a song she recorded made it on to the Bulworth soundtrack in 1998 and she went on to release numerous successful albums. In addition, Eve has <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">collaborated with artists like Gwen Stefani</a> and Alicia Keys, further cementing her successful career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"> 6 Times Dr. Dre Rose From Tragedy To Maintain His Success</a></span></p><h2 id=the-game-10-million>The Game – $10 Million</h2><p>The rapper, producer and actor got his start by signing with Aftermath and mentored by the iconic artist, Dr. Dre himself. In fact, The Game, born Jayceon Terrell Taylor was in demand, creating an <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">artistic feud</a> between Sean Combs and Dr. Dre, who both wanted to sign the young talent. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, in the end, Dre paired him up with 50 Cent and his G-Unit label and he’s gone on to earn nominations for BET, Grammy and Billboard Awards.</p><h2 id=50-cent-40-million>50 Cent – $40 Million</h2><p>Born <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Curtis James Jackson III</a>, 50 Cent didn’t have a great start in the music industry. With a string of arrests as a teen, controversial music and then being attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother’s home in Queens, the recording industry had all but shut him out. That was until the rapper met Eminem and Dr. Dre and signed a $1 million record deal with Aftermath. Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">50 Cent filed bankruptcy</a> in 2015, but don’t worry, the popular musician and actor is still making an average of $4 to $6 million per year with new music, endorsements and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendrick-lamar-75-million>Kendrick Lamar – $75 Million</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">fellow Compton rapper</a> had released several mixed tapes throughout the 2000’s but it wasn’t until he signed with Aftermath Entertainment in 2012 that his first major studio album “Good Kid, mA.A.d city” that Lamar went on to sell over a million copies in the U.S. alone. Lamar has appeared on dozens of singles with the likes of Robin Thicke, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a> and Kanye West. He’s won 13 Grammy’s to date and the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his album “Damn”.</p><h2 id=snoop-dogg-150-million>Snoop Dogg – $150 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By all accounts, he’s got a unique relationship with <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">lifestyle icon Martha Stewart</a>, but long before this, Snoop was discovered for his musical skills in 1992 by Dr. Dre. Cordozar Calvin Broadus also had a history of arrests but his talent couldn’t be denied. He joined Death Row Records and released his album “Doggystyle”, debuting at number one on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Album charts. He and Dre remained friends, even after Dre formed the Aftermath label and in 2022, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Snoop purchased the brand name rights to his first record label</a>, Death Row Records.</p><h2 id=eminem-250-million>Eminem – $250 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, Dre had just released his first album under Aftermath Entertainment, it didn’t do as commercially well as he had expected and he was about to give up. That is, until he met a 26-year-old Detroit rapper and identified Eminem’s unique and extremely popular sound. Dre signed the up-and-coming star and helped catapult him to the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">ninth bestselling musical artist of all time</a>. Eminem has earned 15 Grammy’s, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Awards and an Academy Award for his work on the 8 Mile soundtrack.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">A Look At The Most Expensive Houses Snoop Dogg Has Lived In</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Things</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMm6Cgn5WowW6t0a2grKyjYrGqv8KorZ6qlZl6o8WMnalmnKKafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./malinda-williams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Malinda Williams dating?
