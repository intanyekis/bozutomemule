It was back in 2016 when the streamer announced that it ordered a full season of The Punisher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series sees Jon Bernthal play the titular character once more after being introduced in Netflix’s other Marvel series, Daredevil. And while The Punisher, Daredevil, and other Marvel shows on Netflix gained a lot of following, the streamer canceled the entire lineup as <a href=#>it seemingly parted ways with Marvel</a>.</p><p>Since then, fans have been wondering if the Washington native would ever play Marvel’s famous vigilante again. And while it may have been hinted recently that he’ll be making his MCU debut soon (<a href=#>there were even rumors of a Punisher movie once</a>), Bernthal has been incredibly busy outside of the comics world lately.</p><p>So far, he’s starred in various critically acclaimed movies. What’s more, Bernthal has even found time to jump back into episodic work too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-bernthal-took-on-various-movie-roles-after-the-punisher>Jon Bernthal Took On Various Movie Roles After The Punisher</h2><p>Months after Bernthal wrapped up his time in The Punisher, the actor was seen in James Mangold’s Oscar-winning film Ford v Ferrari with Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The film tells the story of American car designer Carroll Shelby (Damon) and driver Ken Miles’ (Bale) desire to build a race car that would allow Ford to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernthal portrayed Ford executive Lee Iacocca </a>who later gets credited for the creation of Ford’s Mustang.</p><p>“He’s such an extraordinary figure,” the actor said of Iacocca. “Over the years I’ve gotten to play these strong, muscular, sort of technically masculine characters, and with Lee I saw something in him that was equally as strong and equally as masculine, but his powers were different. They were his integrity and his honesty and his loyalty and his ingenuity.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About 'The Punisher' And 'The Walking Dead' Star Jon Bernthal</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Bernthal also reunited with director Taylor Sheridan (they previously worked together on Sicario and Wind River) for the action drama Those Who Wish Me Dead with Angelina Jolie, Finn Little, Nicholas Hoult, and Aiden Gillen.</p><p>In the movie, he plays a deputy sheriff who puts his life on the life to defend his young nephew (Little) who has been trying to evade two assassins (Hoult and Gillen) in the Montana Wilderness with the help of his ex who also happens to be a smokejumper (Jolie).</p><h2 id=jon-branched-out-into-different-genres>Jon Branched Out Into Different Genres</h2><p>And while Bernthal has some familiarity with Sheridan’s style, the film still felt different from their other collaborations as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it goes straight into the heart of the action</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“This was not like his other work. But I really, really trust him,” the actor said of Sheridan. “He really wanted it to be, as you said: no fat, no exposition, no deep dives in character like a lot of his other work. He really wanted his characters to be revealed through the action, which is really great.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Bernthal also joined the cast of the Oscar-winning film King Richard, which tells the story of how Richard Williams (Will Smith) coached his daughters Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena (Demi Singleton) to become the tennis legends that they are today.</p><p>In the movie, Bernthal plays tennis coach Rick Macci who is also known for coaching other tennis stars.</p><h2 id=more-recently-jon-bernthal-also-starred-in-this-cop-drama>More Recently, Jon Bernthal Also Starred In This Cop Drama</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bernthal may have been busy with films, but the actor still found time for tv projects. This includes the HBO crime drama We Own This City, which tells the story of the Baltimore Police Department's (BPD) Gun Trace Task Force and the corruption that was uncovered within the organization.</p><p>This resulted in the arrest of several members of the task force, including Sgt. Wayne Jenkins who Bernthal portrays in the miniseries.</p><p>To prepare for his role, the actor arrived in Boston months before they were going to start shooting to shadow officers in the BPD. He also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remained embedded with the unit even as cameras started rolling</a>.</p><p>“There were most nights where I worked full days on the set and then I’d go with Detective Severino – my buddy Dre – right from set to drug raids,” the actor revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are The Netflix Marvel Shows Coming To Disney+</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Bernthal is also attached to two upcoming films, including a rumored sequel to the 2016 film The Accountant with Ben Affleck. In addition, there are also rumors floating regarding the actor making his way to the MCU just like his fellow Netflix Marvel stars Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio.</p><p>At the recent C2E2, Rosario Dawson seemingly let it slip that “Punisher [is] happening again.” The actress last worked with Bernthal on Daredevil where she reprised her role as Charlie Temple.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jon Bernthal And Other Actors Who Stay In Character Between Scenes</a></span></p><p>Since Dawson made her remarks, however, Marvel Studios hasn’t confirmed anything. At the same time, the actress also later took to social media clarifying, “I can't be trusted…! Getting intel from fans during signings is iffy apparently. My bad. I get excited. Confirmation is key when you're told what you want to hear…”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Until any confirmation is made, all fans can do is keep their fingers crossed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbOp2SbnaKjwamty2aroZ1dpcKvtdKhnKtlnZjCcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./melissa-rivers-inherits-over-100-million-of-joan-rivers-estate-20142210.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melissa Rivers Inherits Over $100 Million of Joan Rivers' Estate">&larr;
