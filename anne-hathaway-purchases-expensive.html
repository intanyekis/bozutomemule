In fact, she's technically considered to be one of the highest-paid actresses in the industry for the past few years, as well as one of the highest-grossing actresses in the past century due to starring in several box office successes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Top 10 Highest Grossing Actresses Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Having won numerous awards for her work, she's come a long way from the frizzy-haired teenager she was in The Princess Diaries. And with a net worth of $35 million, she's definitely seen some returns on her hard work!&nbsp;Take a look at some of the&nbsp;most expensive things Anne was able to purchase over the years.</p><h2 id=connecticut-mansion>Connecticut Mansion</h2><p>In 2017, Anne and her husband, Adam Schulman, purchased property in Westport, Connecticut for $2.79 million. The 1920's Colonial-style home has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, and resides on one acre of land.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Emma Stone Has Bought</a></span></p><p>With elegant details like French doors, a skylight, black marble countertops, a terrace, a saltwater swimming pool, and a spa, this rustic home screams "expensive!" The property also has a&nbsp;1,518-square-foot barn with its own kitchen. Add&nbsp;a sprawling green garden and you've got yourself a charming home! Anne ended up selling the property last year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=manhattan-apartment>Manhattan&nbsp;Apartment</h2><p>By far Anne's most expensive property was the penthouse apartment she rented with ex-boyfriend&nbsp;Raffaello Follieri for $37,000 per month! If you'd rather not rent, you can try and buy the place for a cool $19.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Placed The Winning Bid For Insanely Expensive Things At Auction</a></span></p><p>Residing in the Olympic Tower, it overlooks the city and provides a great view of&nbsp;St. Patrick's Cathedral. With a living room the size of a ballroom, a chef's kitchen, a dining table that seats up to 12 people, a media room, five bedrooms, and six bathrooms, this property is&nbsp;fit for royalty.</p><h2 id=other-new-york-properties>Other New York Properties</h2><p>After becoming a mother, Anne wanted to live more modestly and decided to downsize. For a time, she and her husband lived in a Brooklyn loft located in the Clock Tower in the Dumbo neighborhood.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Best Surprise Celebrity Hair Cuts</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They purchased the property for $4.1 million. Now, she and her growing family reside in a New York City apartment that they bought for $2.55 million. The apartment boasts skylights, high ceilings, and a gorgeous private rooftop terrace with breathtaking views. Anne has lived here since 2016. She seems to be settled for now, but could easily buy some&nbsp;more property if she wanted to!</p><h2 id=2011-oscar-jewelry>2011 Oscar Jewelry</h2><p>Getting dolled up for something as iconic as the Oscars is a given, but when Anne was the actual host of the awards show in 2011, she had to take her look even further.&nbsp;While strutting down the red carpet, Anne made jaws drop by rocking a Tiffany Lucida Star diamond necklace, diamond earrings, and ring -- worth about $10 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Things George Clooney Owns</a></span></p><p>But don't worry! She didn't purchase the jewelry, just rented them for the event. She only had to cough up $750,000 to wear the pieces for a night out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2011-oscar-dress>2011 Oscar Dress</h2><p>Since she hosted the event, she had multiple outfit changes throughout the night. Her red carpet look, however, made history as one of the top ten most expensive dresses ever worn on the carpet. Anne modeled a gorgeous red silk Valentino gown, worth around $80,000. And keep in mind, that was just one of the eight dresses she wore for the event! Add up her entire wardrobe&nbsp;for the night, and the total has to be in the millions. The fact that she paired this particular Valentino dress with the $10 million jewelry certainly made a statement!</p><h2 id=chantecaille-gold-eye-masks>Chantecaille Gold Eye Masks</h2><p>Face masks can run pretty cheap, but Anne was willing to splurge for the highest quality face masks out there. In an August 2019 interview with Allure, Anne revealed that the last beauty product she ordered off of Amazon was the&nbsp;Chantecaille Gold Eye Masks, which cost $195.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 15 Celebs Who Were Never The Same People After Their Iconic Roles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So expensive but truly, deeply brilliant," Anne said about the masks. At least she's aware that's quite a bit of money for a face mask! The mask supposedly contains real 24 Karat gold, and is said to help plump, smooth, and moisturize the skin around your eyes.</p><h2 id=japanese-infrared-light-face-wand>Japanese Infrared-Light Face Wand</h2><p>Anne sure is a fan of taking care of her skin! In the same Allure interview, the actress was asked what the most expensive item in her beauty kit was. She revealed it was a&nbsp;Japanese infrared-light face wand, recommended to her by make-up artist and cosmetic designer Gucci Westman. This product costs at least $250 and uses wavelengths of natural red&nbsp;and infrared light to boost blood flow, stimulate collagen production, and smooth wrinkles. You just hold the light up to your face for fifteen minutes and let it do its thing. Hey, Anne seems to have some really good skin, so maybe this is why!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audi-a5>Audi A5</h2><p>As every person with money knows, flashy sports cars are a must-have when it comes to showing off your success. Anne and her husband have frequently been spotted driving a matte black Audi A5 over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Expensive Things Owned By Mark Zuckerberg</a></span></p><p>Although it's hard to make out what type she has specifically, we can assume it cost some big bucks. After all, the 2019 iteration of the Audi A5 starts at $44,200! Back in 2009, a paparazzi chasing the car on a bike crashed into the Audi. Fortunately, only the side mirror was damaged and the photographer only suffered minor injuries.</p><h2 id=audi-r8-spyder>Audi R8 Spyder</h2><p>While she is said to still have the Audi R5,&nbsp;Anne went on to buy a silver Audi R8 Spyder as well. She's more frequently seen in this upgraded vehicle now. Audi R8's happen to be the dream car of many Marvel fans, as the character Tony Stark drove it in six different films.&nbsp;Funnily enough, Anne has also played a superhero! She coincidentally started driving this iconic car right around the time she starred as Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises.&nbsp;Her character isn't part of the Marvel universe like Tony Stark -- Catwoman is a DC character -- but it seems like the Audi R8 is fit for any superhero! The newest version of this car has a starting price of $169,900.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=philanthropy>Philanthropy</h2><p>Anne's biggest passion besides acting is giving back.&nbsp;There are too many charities she supports to name them all, but there are a few notable stand-outs worth mentioning. The actress donated $25,000 of her own money to the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, which helps pay off legal fees for victims of sexual harassment and assault within the entertainment industry. Another&nbsp;noteworthy instance is when she sold her wedding pictures to magazines in 2012, and&nbsp;donated the money she received to four different organizations: Freedom to Marry, The American Cancer Society, St. Jude's Research Hospital, and The Girl Effect. She could've kept that money for herself, but she admirably spent it on causes she cares about.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Tiger Woods Has Bought</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8CnpZ5lmJbBqa3WmrBmqKWnsKmt0p6qZp2opbKvv8ivnGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./all-about-stitches-rapper-wife-height-face-tattoo-is-died-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Stitches (rapper): Wife, Height, Face Tattoo.
