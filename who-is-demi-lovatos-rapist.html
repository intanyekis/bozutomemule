She also revealed that when she overdosed in 2018, the dealer who laced her heroin sexually assaulted her. She went back to that same person when she relapsed shortly after.</p><p>“I called him back and told him, ‘No, I’m going to f-k you.'” Nothing was fixed, and nothing was taken away. It aggravated my feelings. “For some reason, that was my way of reclaiming power,” the singer, 28, explained in the YouTube documentary. “All it did was bring me back to my knees, pleading with God for assistance.”</p><p>The former Disney star then revealed that this was not the first time something similar had occurred.<br>“I was in a similar situation when I was a teenager.” “I was raped and lost my virginity,” the “Sober” singer explained. “I called that person back a month later and tried to make it right by asserting control, but it only made me feel worse.” Lovato was 15 years old at the time of the rape. That year, 2007, she auditioned for both Camp Rock and Sonny With a Chance, both of which she landed.</p><h2>Demi Lovato’s Addiction Struggle in Her Own Words</h2><p>“We were hooking up when I said, ‘Hey, this isn’t going anywhere.'” I’m a virgin, and I don’t want to lose it like this.’ And it didn’t matter to them because they did it anyway. ” the “Alone” singer explained. “I internalized it. I told myself it was my fault because I still went in the room with him. I still hooked up with him.”</p><p>She was also afraid to speak out at the time because she was “part of that Disney crowd” who publicly declared they were waiting for marriage to have sex.</p><p>“I didn’t&nbsp;have a romantic first time&nbsp;with anybody. That was not it for me, and that sucked, then I had to see that person all the time,” she explained. “So, I stopped eating and coped in other ways — cutting, throwing up, whatever.&nbsp;My bulimia got so bad&nbsp;that I started throwing up blood for the first time.”</p><p>The New Mexico native revealed that when she told someone about the rape, the perpetrator was not punished.</p><h2>Through the Years: Demi Lovato</h2><p>“What, I’m supposed to come out to the public after saying, ‘I have a promise ring’? Six months later, I’m supposed to say, ‘Well, actually I had sex, even though it was rape.’ Some people aren’t going to see it that way. At least the Christian Southern girl inside of me didn’t see it that way because sex was not normalized as a child or in the South,” she said.</p><p></p><p>After a brief pause, Lovato added, You know what, f—k it. I’m just gonna say it. My #MeToo story is about me telling somebody that someone did this to me, and they never got in trouble for it. They never got taken out of the movie they were in. I just kept it quiet because I’ve always had something to say. I’m tired of opening my mouth. There’s the tea.”</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Why Did Demi Lovato And Wilmer Valderrama Break Up?&nbsp;</a></li><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Selena Gomez Is Afflicted With Lupus, An Incurable Disease: Everything You Need To Know</a></li><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Selena Gomez Net Worth 2022: American Singer & Songwriter Income, Career & More Updates!</a></li></ul><h2>FAQ:</h2><h3 id=exacc_cUYOY-bRCYys0QTCn7GYCQ_3 class="iDjcJe IX9Lgd wwB5gf" aria-hidden=true>How old was Demi while filming Camp Rock?</h3><p>Demi was 15 years old when Camp Rock premiered on Disney Channel on June 20, 2008.</p><h3 id=exacc_TU4OY4DQAcy24t4Prpm60AQ_1 class="iDjcJe IX9Lgd wwB5gf" aria-hidden=true>Did Demi Lovato get married?</h3><p>Lovato has never been married and does not have a husband.</p><h3>What ethnicity is Demi Lovato?</h3>Her father was of Nuevomexicano ancestry, with mostly Spanish and Native American ancestors, and came from a long line of New Mexicans; he also had distant Portuguese and Jewish ancestors.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6y1sHnIrGSdnZ2eeq271ZqrqKtdp66xtdKtZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eniko-parrish-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-92453-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eniko Parrish Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
