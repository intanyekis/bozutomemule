The Shahs of Sunset alum had a difficult few hours before her second child came into the world. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She had a medical emergency that almost took her and the baby's life. But, with good medical attention, she got through the difficulties and is now sharing her experience. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Lilly Ghalichi Welcomed&nbsp;Second Baby, Son 'Kash-Mir'</h2><p>Ghalichi and Mir welcomed their <a href=# rel="follow noopener">second child</a>, son Kashton Mir, on June 24, 2022. Their story of having their second kid isn't as jolly as it now sounds. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>A day before, they were immediately called to the hospital to have an unplanned delivery. She had to be induced after her doctors took early notice of a rare pregnancy condition called HELPP syndrome.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Lilly Ghalichi shared the birth date of her second baby, Kashton Mir, on Instagram.</strong> (Photo: Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ghalichi had been experiencing a few symptoms near the end of her pregnancy, such as extreme nausea, blurry vision, etc. And even though she wrote those off as normal, her doctors, fortunately, did not.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Upon reaching the hospital, a journey&nbsp;she also documented and later shared on her&nbsp;Instagram stories, she got induced. She said the experience was the "hardest" she had had till now. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A few slides later, Ghalichi posted a video where she was shaking with pain as the doctors tried to force her body into labor. She had been in that state for over eight hours.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They had reached the hospital at 8 PM on June 23, and at 5 AM on&nbsp;June 24, she had a discussion with her doctor, Dr. Thais Aliabadi, about the C-section. They realized that the baby's heartbeat was dropping with every contraction she had.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Ghalichi discussing a C-section with her doctor before the birth of her second child.</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dr. Aliabadi said she would give it her last shot to get the baby out, something she succeeded in.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After the delivery, Ghalichi and Mir named their son going with an idea her friend, Kim Zolciak-Biermann, gave them when they had their first child, daughter Alara. She had suggested they call the kid Kash if they had a son, and that way, he could be 'Kashmir.'</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><p><strong>Ghalichi revealed how she and her husband chose the name for their second baby.</strong> (Photo: Instagram)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The first time, they had a girl. But this time, they went with Kash as they had a son. Mir came up with Kashton, and that became his name.</p><h2>Lilly Ghalichi Went to the Delivery Room Glammed Up</h2><p>In her IG stories, Ghalichi documented not only the delivery but the things she did before and after. One of the things she shared was how she got ready for her delivery and how nervous she was during the whole thing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Right after the hospital called her to come in, she started getting ready for her stay there. The first thing she did was get her makeup done.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Lilly Ghalichi getting her makeup done before going to the hospital.</strong> (Photo: Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"They don't like glam at the hospital anymore," she said in one of her IG stories but got her amazing look, anyway. Her makeup artist was Ella Vardanyan, and her hair stylist was Brandon Palestino.</p><p>The couple also packed a lot of stuff into their car for their hospital stay.</p><p>After returning from the hospital with a healthy Kashton, she documented her postpartum routine in her stories. Ghalichi decided it was not a bad thing to be vulnerable and discussed her postpartum body and how she was taking care of her skin. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZobm6ecahmKWhk522bq7Am7BnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-10-best-teen-movies-of-all-time-w459321.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 Best Teen Movies of All Time">&larr;
