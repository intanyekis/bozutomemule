While Swift is arguably the more famous of the two, Kelce's 2024 Super Bowl win and his association with his pop star girlfriend have seen<a href=#> him experience a surge in popularity</a>.</p><p>Due to his sudden rise in notoriety, Travis Kelce's every move is being closely examined by fans and the media. Case in point, when the Are You Smarter Than A Celebrity? host was recently filmed letting loose at a Taylor Swift concert. While Kelce has been to many of Swift's shows, this particular appearance stood out as the tight end receiver appeared to also be very 'hands-on' with fans.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelce-jana-kramer.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Reportedly Thinks Jana Kramer Is Using Him For Fame">Travis Kelce Reportedly Thinks Jana Kramer Is Using Him For Fame</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce isn't too worried about criticism as he believes Jana Kramer is just talking about him to get attention.</p><h2 id=travis-kelce-got-hands-on-with-swifties-at-taylor-swift-concert>Travis Kelce Got Hands On With Swifties At Taylor Swift Concert</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since<strong> Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce began dating</strong>, it's been apparent that the two are very supportive of each other and their careers. While Swift has taken time out to watch Kelce at his football games, including cheering him on as he and the K<strong>ansas City Chiefs won the Superbowl</strong>, Kelce in return has been to many of her concerts, even dancing and singing along to the lyrics of her songs.</p><p>This is in stark contrast to <strong>Swift's ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn</strong>, who was notorious for preferring to keep their relationship as low-key and private as possible. Therefore, the likelihood of seeing Alwyn interacting with Swift's fans was slim to none. However, Kelce proved to be the opposite during the European leg of <strong>Taylor Swift's Eras tour</strong> when he was captured on video interacting with Swifties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The charming interaction occurred at Swift's concert in Paris, wherein Kelce and other A-list guests were stationed in the VIP area. During one particular segment of the show, Travis Kelce ventured out into the isle of the area and began to dance and sing along to Swift's song Karma. As fans expressed their excitement at seeing the tight end receiver up close, Kelce shocked the crowd by shaking their hands and giving them high-fives.</p><p>The interaction quickly went viral on social media, with many <strong>Swifties praising Kelce</strong> for being so humble and kind to fans whilst being loyal to Taylor Swift. One fan wrote on a TikTok video showing the interaction, "Taylor got a good one. He's literally the sweetest guy ever, not only to the fans but to her. He's so genuine. I love this for her."</p><h2 id=travis-kelce-had-a-surprising-reaction-to-a-fan-wearing-his-jersey-at-the-eras-tour>Travis Kelce Had A Surprising Reaction To A Fan Wearing His Jersey At The Eras Tour</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Travis Kelce holding hands with Swifties </strong>wasn't the only interaction with fans the star had that is making headlines.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an article in Parade</a>, Kelce also had an amazing reaction to seeing a fan wearing his jersey at one of Swift's concerts in Paris.</p><p>The interaction was caught on video, as Travis Kelce walked by a fan who was wearing his number 87 football jersey.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pressure-mounts-on-travis-kelce-to-propose-to-taylor-swift_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Pressure Mounts On Travis Kelce To Propose To Taylor Swift As Her Eras Tour Set Changes">Pressure Mounts On Travis Kelce To Propose To Taylor Swift As Her Eras Tour Set Changes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's fans and other observers have been expecting Travis Kelce to propose to Taylor Swift very soon as her Eras tour changes.</p><p>In the video seen above, Kelce can be seen smiling.
