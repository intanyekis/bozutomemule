However, the names of the schools where he earned his primary and high school education are unknown because he is yet to reveal them.

The sports journalist took to her Instagram handle to upload a photo of her son and express her joy.</p><p>She also stated in the post that her father was born on the same day as her son. The sports journalist further stated that there was no better moment than saying happy birthday to her father and showing him his grandson.
