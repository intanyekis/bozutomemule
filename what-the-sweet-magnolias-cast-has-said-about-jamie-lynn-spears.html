Despite the good news, fans were also upset that Jamie Lynn Spears, who <a href=#>fans wanted to be booted from the show</a>, was sticking around.</p><p>The public perception around Spears is well-known, but how does the cast of the show feel about her? We have the details below.</p><h2 id=39-sweet-magnolias-39-has-had-two-seasons>'Sweet Magnolias' Has Had Two Seasons</h2><p>Two years ago, Sweet Magnolias made its debut on Netflix, and there was a lot of anticipation for the show. It was an adaptation of the Sherryl Woods novels, meaning that the show had a lot to live up to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Featuring JoAnna Garcia Swisher leading a talented cast, Sweet Magnolias has now aired two seasons on Netflix. The series has been able to generate some buzz with the fans, who would love to see a third season hit the streaming platform in due time.</p><p>Swisher herself has stated that she is on board for a third season, should Netflix give it the green light.</p><p>"I think that there is a great excitement and willingness to do it. I think that Netflix has always been incredibly supportive of the show, and we feel like they really love it," she said.</p><p>The show has a lot going for it, but a major talking point has been Jamie Lynn Spears and her involvement with the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears Looks Back On ‘Sweet Magnolias,’ Calling It A ‘Dream Job’</a></span></p><h2 id=jamie-lynn-spears-plays-noreen>Jamie Lynn Spears Plays Noreen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2019, Jamie Lynn Spears made headlines when it was announced that she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joining the cast of Sweet Magnolias</a>. Spears had found success on TV as a younger star, and people were excited to see what she was going to be bringing to the table on the Netflix series.</p><p>In the announcement, Netflix stated that Spears would play Noreen Fitzgibbon, "a young woman who is determined to build a new life for herself after a series of bad choices."</p><p>For fans of Spears, this was huge news. Outside of paying Zoey Brooks on Zoey 101, Spears had largely stayed away from acting. So, a return to form on a Netflix show with a wealth of potential was a refreshing sight to see.</p><p>Spears has been involved with both seasons of the show, and fans have enjoyed what she's brought to the series. However, given everything that has been unfolding between Spears and her sister, many have wondered what her castmates on the show think about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is 'Sweet Magnolias' Actress Brooke Elliott?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-the-cast-has-said-about-her>What The Cast Has Said About Her?</h2><p>So, what has the cast of Sweet Magnolias had to say about Jamie Lynn Spears during her time on the show? Well, in spite of the public perception surrounding her, those that worked with her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have had nice things to say about her</a>.</p><p>"She is a dear friend and a wonderful mother,” said Joanna Garcia Swisher.</p><p>Heather Headey, who didn't get to spend too much time working with Spears, had plenty of kind things to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Jamie Lynn and I have not had many scenes together because, you know, Helen is not too fond of her. She’s getting there. But Jamie Lynn has always been so sweet. She’s so professional and kind and soft-spoken and just a sweet, very kind heart trying her best to be a good mommy and a good wife [to husband Jamie Watson]," the actress said.</p><p>"I appreciate that in her. I didn’t know what to expect when I was gonna run into Jamie Lynn, you know, and found myself just sitting with her and, and we would talk and laugh and giggle. When I came into the show, my baby was 3 months old and hers [daughter Ivey, now 3] was about a year and so she was understanding me, you know, breast-feeding in the trailer and pumping. And so, she’d be like, ‘Just do this and get this and get this for that.’ … But it was great to have, you know, that [advice] from her," she continued.</p><p>Jamie Lynn's time in the headlines has certainly painted a less than ideal picture of her, but her castmates seem to enjoy working with her on Sweet Magnolias.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears Is Georgia Bound As She Gets Ready For 'Sweet Magnolias' Season Two</a></span></p><p>Sweet Magnolias season two is currently streaming on Netflix, so fans can now get up-to-date on the story.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears Has A Podcast In The Works That Nobody Asked For</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYysrp6dpGK6orPNqKOimaNisKK%2F02afmqtdqK6qsIyamaitpGK3ornInmSlsZ6jerS8xJqprGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jordyn-woods-breaks-the-internet-with-video-of-her-booty-massage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jordyn Woods Breaks the Internet With Video of Her Booty Massage">&larr;
